# JavaGame
A simulation built in Java using a graphical engine library.

This was completed for a unviersity subject in Semester 2 of 2020. The goal of the projects was to make use of object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, data abstraction, polymorphism, and inheritance. 

Project 1 involved implementing a baseline simulation of characters traversing a game board. Project 2 involved a fully-realised simulation of actors interacting with objects on the game board, while operating with their own individual goals.
